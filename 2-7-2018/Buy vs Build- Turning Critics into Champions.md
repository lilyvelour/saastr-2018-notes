# Build vs Buy: Turning Critics into Champions

## Speaker

* Edith Harbaugh - CEO, LaunchDarkly (@edith_h)

## Notes

* First person to sell to - yourself
* 2nd person to sell to - co-founder
* Employees, investors, customers - founders are also salespeople
* #1 problem for startups - nobody knows you exist
* #2 problem - no one cares
* If someone is talking buy vs build, you have a potential buyer!
* Example of buy vs build: roast chicken
  * Cost
  * Time
  * Customization
  * Something core to you
  * Pride
* Tech example: EasyBloom - internet enabled garden sensor
    * Launched in November (bad timing!)
    * Expected sales - thousands/mo
    * Actual sales - 79
    * Failed launches - you can't screw up any more
    * Backlash from gardeners - they didn't want technology getting in their way
    * Reasons (cost, time, customization, core, pride)
    * Fixes
      * Lower price
      * Appeal to brown thumbs
      * Customization: gadget geeks
      * At core: Pitch for that one finicky plant
      * Pride: Marketing campaign - present for their parents
      * Ended up selling over a million dollars worth of EasyBloom units
* LaunchDarkly - feature flags as a service
  * First step - awareness
    * Show HackerNews
    * Blogs
    * Product Hunt
    * Talks
    * Podcast
    * Articles
    * Quora
    * Message boards
    * Try to look as big as you can - better to look silly than for people to not know you exist
  * Initial reaction - "I could build that in two hours, it's booleans"
    * Sign of hope - "No thanks, I already have one"
    * People who didn't use feature flags were a bad fit
  * Went to offices and let people show their feature flags - what they liked and didn't like
  * Strategy - parity with homegrown systems
  * Build the hard features
  * Publish blueprint
    * Show how hard it was to build this system
    * Argument for this - "you have better things to do with your time"
    * Helped draw content and SEO ("how to build feature flags")
  * Be careful about pride (don't tell an engineer they can't do something)
* Example (Bloomberg terminals)
  * "We'll build it ourself in 9 months"
  * "Great! We'll offer you this for free for 9 months while you build it"
* Anti-tactics
    * Religious conversion
      * Make sure they actually want the solution (targeting - otherwise, nurture campaign)
      * Make sure they're in the right part in the process
    * "You're not smart enough"
      * No one likes being called dumb
      * People like being told they can be smarter if they use their product
    * "Move off your better system"
      * Too entrenched
      * Don't talk about eliminating a person, instead talk about eliminating a task
* Tactics
  * Objections as blog posts (content marketing - can be evergreen)
    * Objection handling 1-on-1 is good, objection handle at scale is better
    * "What if you go down" - content marketing on reliability
    * Important to keep tuned to objections
    * Propsects ask a lot of questions when they care
  * Technical debt
    * Flip the objection and educate on how to do something better
    * Homegrown solutions are the ones resulting in technical debt (buy vs. build) - "Here's not how to X..."
  * Best practices
    * Seen as a friend and trusted advisor
    * "I'm going to take your blueprints and use it" - delayed sale
    * When you try to build something, you're willing to not build it again
* At the beginning, critics were right
  * It could be built quickly
  * Later though, it became more helpful
* Later, new critics
  * But customers started replying and defending
  * Older critics became champions
