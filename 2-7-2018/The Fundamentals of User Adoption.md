# The Fundamentals of User Adoption

## Speaker

Rachel Orston - CEO, UserIQ (@rachelorston)

## Notes

* SaaS with -5% churn has 73% higher revenue than a SaaS with 5% churn
* If a company grows at 20% annually, it has a 92% chance of ceasing to exist within a few years
* Churn & burn - a tough starting point
* Retention is a long-term strategy
* Did you skip customer adoption
  * Do you know who your users are
  * Do you understand the value you are bringing to them
* For freemium - your user is your buyer
* Who is your best customer
* Start with why
  * Time to wow (measure this)
  * Why leads to wow
* How quickly do our leads convert to opportunities?
  * Go through product
  * Identify questions in the voice of your customers
  * If it's not intuitive, who cares? Why does this feature exist?
* Get to the what
  * Identify the top 10-20 behaviors and user flows that are used by retained users
  * Pay attention to what they're doing (segmentation)
  * Compare against churned users
    * If there are differences, find out why
    * If there is correlation, those might be sticky behaviors or a good starting point
  * Focus on the retained users
  * If you don't have enough data - ask
* Customer success + Product management - the marriage of why and what
  * Product team is focused on what
  * Customer success team is focused on why
  * Combine the data, both care about user adoption - missed opportunity
* If not thinking about both what and why, you don't know your users the way you think you do
* Where to start efforts
  * Just started
  * Time's up
  * Just got paid
  * Unexpected action
  * No expected action
* User adoption - offline interactions
  * Moments of truth
    * Major turning points in the relationship
    * Crisis
    * Unexpected delights
* Look at user adoption as a way to improve user relationships outside of the product
* Thank your users, get advocates
