# Winning a Vertical Market

## Speakers

* Ara Mahdessian - CEO, ServiceTitan
* Will Griffith - Founding Partner, ICONIQ

## Notes

* ServiceTitan - "Software for plumbers" (home services)
* Vertical markets start with founders looking to solve pain points
* 90% of vertical market plays are not founded in SF
* Typically, founders see the problem themselves in the industry

* Horizontal: something any industry or company can use
* Vertical: specific to a typical industry
  * Format: A (solution) for B (vertical)
* Vertical markets: 100bn+ revenue opportunity, trillion+ market cap opportunity
* Playbook has to fit the market
* Vertical has a much lower customer size
* Can make that up in terms of revenue

### About vertical markets

* Software in vertical markets has to be tailored for those workflows
* While needs are very tailored for the vertical, every vertical has the same needs
* Many people in verticals know each other, it spreads very quickly

### What's required, what's achievable

* Goal is 100% market penetration
* Best companies get to 70-80+%

### Playbook

1. Importance of subject matter expertise
   * Need to understand the customer's business
   * Have to build a "tailored suit" to match their workflow
   * Earn trust, speak about pain points
2. Fastest way to scale is to deal with the leverage of customer success
   * Testimonials, on video, on how the product improves their lives
   * Huge viral effect
3. At some point, will get an opportunity to partner with a big name
4. Once this happens, others notice
   * Other vendors want to partner or integrate with you
5. Once delivering success and earning trust, reputation, can address other workflows, create value, upsell to customer
6. Finally, can think of adjacent markets

### The "magic moment"

* Moment when you know you reach that tipping point
* When you walk into a prospect's office and they are eager/excited
* When you start seeing inbound, enterprise deals, investors calling

### Q&A

* On marketing differences:

  * #1 thing, get really, really good at targeting
    * Manual enrichment initially for some industries
    * Machine learning to help find accounts
  * Downstream: Leverage close rates and customer success
  * Speak to customers, not at customers. Get a sense of their pain points first.

* Approaches to getting vertical size:

  * Top down approach for getting data
  * Rare to not get data - may not be 100% reliable, but 75% is enough

* Churn

  * Vertical markets get really low churn
  * 4% annual for SMBs/home services/no contracts
  * Deliver great value
  * The more workflows you address, the bigger the switching cost

* How soon to move into adjacent markets

  * Many of them have been cautious to expand into additional markets
  * Want 100% market penetration

* Landing first whale of a client

  * Always going to want that opportunity earlier than you're ready
  * Find the one willing to take the chance on you, one that believes in you
  * Can only get that if you have domain expertise
  * Iconic people in the industry willing to fight the battle with you

* Subject matter expertise and scaling

  * A challenge to scale SME of the founder
  * Have to invest and document SME from founders
  * Leverage every resource out there
  * Try to hire industry expertise/people who have worked in the industry

* At what point to move to next vertical

  * 400 employees, only cautiously moving now

* Finding investors
  * Good human beings
  * Conviction in our playbook, no need to convince them on the playbook
  * Alignment around core values of the business
  * Value add that they bring to the table
