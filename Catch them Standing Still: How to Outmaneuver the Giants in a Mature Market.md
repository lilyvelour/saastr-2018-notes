## Highfive story

* Shan Sinha started with SharePoint at MS
* Started a tool to synchronize documents from the cloud, bought by Google in 2010
* Turned the product into Google Drive, got to run Google Apps
* In late 2000s-2010s: "Why would I move to the cloud" -> "When am I going to move to the cloud", the beginnings of SaaS at scale, cloud business models
* Mid-to-end of 2012: Opportunity to solve "the first 15 minutes" of a meeting
* Ended up leaving to start Highfive

## Framework for attacking the market

* Background: lots of competitors at the time (ex: Cisco)
* Have to be honest with yourself
* One of the first questions: What sort of market are you actually in?
  * Established category, well understood
  * Video conferencing had 20 years of history, well understood space
    * New category - something you were unable to do before
      * Google docs (documents in the cloud) was a new category at the time
* The way you think about building in each scenario is different
* Larger foundation of expectation in a market well understood
* For a market that is new - the job is to disproportionally delight end users
* How do we make something both unique but get it into a market that's established?
* Idea isn't enough - how do you get it into a customer's hands? That's more important, even if it's worse. Distribution is equally if not more important than the product

* In the earlier stages, so much time spent on the product
* When tackling a well understood space, important to make sure the messaging will land in a differentiated way
* Budget of 30-45 seconds to talk to someone about the product
* Is the message going to resonate? What are we going to say?
* Tested a ton of value props and spent 20-30% of first year and a half in stealth mode trying to understand the value prop and figure out how customers would react while building the technology

### When competing with large companies

* The reason they're large is they took something that worked and are scaling that
* Inherent bias
* Orgizational disincentive to adjust this working strategy; risk-averse
* Will only change if compelled
* Smaller companies can take advantage of this
* Speed/experimentation matters
* Both on the product and market side

### Going directly to the customer

* Context (for Highfive) - old companies, trying to move old technology to new platforms
* Try to partner with resellers, etc. Ecosystem evolved around the old technology
* Took a different approach, sell directly to the customers - didn't need the legacy technology
* More consumer-like approach
* Channel partners later - funding may come from channel partners even

### Difference in strategy from other startups

* Migration of old technologies
* A lot of similarities
* Highfive focused on the end-to-end
